Clay Analogy for Machine Learning
- First, you start with a block of raw clay. 
  At this stage, the clay can be molded into many different forms and be used to serve many different purposes. 
  You decide to use this lump of clay to make a teapot.
  (data ML model)

- So how do you create this teapot? You inspect and analyze the raw clay and decide how to change it to make it look more like the teapot you have in mind.
 the model training algo makes small changes to the model parameters so we achieve our goals

- tea pot made - inspected and evaluated 


Model - generic program made specific by data used to train it
can be modeled into many different forms and serve different purposes

e.g linear regression model used to understand the relationship btwn
the number of cones sold per day and the temp of the day

the same model (liner Regression model ) was used to better understand the relationship between the cost of enrollment and the number of students attending college.

Model Training

How are model training algorithms used to train a model?
- a model training algorithm uses the model to process data and then compares the results against some end goal,
- a model training algorithm gently nudges specific parts of the model in a direction that brings the model closer to achieving the goal.
- Repeats the process  until it determines that its close enough to stop.

Model Inference: Using Your Trained Model
We are ready to use the model inference algorithm to generate predictions using the trained model. This process is often referred to as model inference.
