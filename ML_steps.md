## Define the problem
 to define the problem we need to do the following
 - be specific
 - Think back to the snow cone sales example. Now imagine that you own a frozen treats store and you sell snow cones along with many other products. You wonder, "‘How do I increase sales?" It's a valid question, but it's the opposite of a very specific task. The following examples demonstrate how a machine learning practitioner might attempt to answer that question.
    - “Does adding a $1.00 charge for sprinkles on a hot fudge    sundae increase the sales of hot fudge sundaes?”
    - “Does adding a $0.50 charge for organic flavors in your snow cone increase the sales of snow cones?”

 - Identify the machine learning task we might use to solve this problem.
   This helps you better understand the data you need for a project.

## What is a Machine Learning Task?
 Often, we use the kind of data required to train a model as part of defining a machine learning task

 two common machine learning tasks:

 - ### Supervised learning
 - ### Unsupervised learning
