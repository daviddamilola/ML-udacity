relationship with AI
- ML is a type of AI
- allows computers to learn and improve experiences without been explictly programmed to do so
- ML is how computers learn from data to discover patterns and make predictions
- Supervised learning ( a type of ML)
- Every training sample data set has a label(output value) with it
- the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.
- can be used in things like, predicting the sales price of a house , classifying images
- Unsupervised learning, no labels for training data
- the algorithm tries to identify pattterns and distributions governing the data
- in both supervised and un supervised learning, the machine discovers patterns in data, then humans make use of this patterns to make better
descisions
-Reinforcement Learning
learning what actions to take in a situation to maximise rewards



How ML helps solve problems
In machine learning, the problem solver abstracts away part of their solution as a flexible component called a model,
model training algo adjust the model to real world data
resulting in a trained model that can be used to predict outcomes that are not part of the data set used to train the model
ML automates some of the statistical resoning and pattern matching that a problem solver will traditionally do
Flexibility of the model is key.

The overall goal is to use a model created by a model training algorithm to generate predictions or find patterns in data that can be used to solve a problem.
